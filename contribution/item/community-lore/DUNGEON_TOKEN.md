In the ancient tapestry of Indian myths, the "Dungeon Token" is a sacred amulet, a divine gift from the gods themselves. Crafted from a fallen star's essence, it embodies the cosmic balance. Legend speaks of Lord Vishnu entrusting it to the noble sage Dhruva, who used its power to navigate the hidden realms beneath the earth. Possessing the token marked one as a chosen guardian of dharma, the cosmic order. It bore the weight of destiny and trials, revealing dungeons filled with tests and treasures. Aspiring heroes, guided by its radiant glow, embarked on epic quests to protect and restore harmony to the world.
